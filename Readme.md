# PsGet Repository

Small repository for PowerShell modules that are either homeless or have dysfunctional homes like codeplex that make it difficult to programmatically access the latest release build.

# License

All modules are licensed under their own respective licenses. PsGet community does not hold any rights. If you feel that a given module is being distributed incorrectly, please let us know, ideally with a replacement location for accessing the module's latest release build.
